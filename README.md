## To get start just run
### 🎲 Run Back End 

```
# Clone este repositório
$ git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Bichof/estudo-de-api.git

## run
$ npm start


```

# 🎲 Run front-end
```
## run
$ npx lite-server
# or
## open the 'live server' in index.html


## the return should be a list of names and emails (fake) something very simple, but the focus of this project is to consume and serve an API
```
